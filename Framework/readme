With this framework we are able to grab images from camera, process them using OpenCV (or similar libraries) and finally push them to a GStreamer pipeline. Right now this framework is made for usage at serverside, but it should be easily possible to adapt this framework for use at clientside.

NOTE:
So far only H264 compression is implemented by the framework. MotionJPEG is still under construction.
