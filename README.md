# Eye-Tracker-GPU Implementation

Implementation of some eye tracking algorithms on the GPU. Everything is implemented in Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/](link) and OpenCL. The project currently builds with the nightly version of Rust on Windows with the MSVC compiler (rustc 1.19.0-nightly). 

For OpenCL the AMD APP SDK needs to be installed to the default location.

In theory this project should run on Linux/OSX too.
